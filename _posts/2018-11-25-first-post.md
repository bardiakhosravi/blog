LinkedIn has chanaged the way how candidates are recruited an hired into companies. It has become the go to platform for recruiters to find candidates and present for roles they are working to fill.
At times many of us get weekly messages from recruiters regarding potential roles that we might be a fit for. If you decide to pursue a role that you think would be a good career move you have to be
diligent in ensuring that the role you are going to interview for is what you actually think it is. Asking a few clarifying questions when speaking with the recruiter will help you get a picture
of what the role entails and whether or not it is the dream job you have been waiting for.

# Clarify the Exact Title of the Role

You would be surprised to know that many job titles that have been posted by recruiters or recruitment agencies are different than the actuall title the company is hiring for. I personally have experienced this
numerous times. Either half way through the interviews or at offer stage I find out that the level of the role
is lower that what was presented during the initial stages.

Usually the title that has been posted or is presented is a level higher than what the actuall level is. For example:

| Presented Title | Actual Title |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Chief Architect | Software Architect |
| Senior Developer/Architect | Senior Developer |
| Manager/Director | Manager |

These are examples from my personal experience. The pattern is to have the presented title to be at least one
level higher that the actuall role. Recruiters probably do this to attract candidates. At times companies are open to both so they might provide an opportunity for someone to grow into the higher level role.

Sometimes there is no clear line between the two levels e.g Senior Develop/Architect. Having said that, the responsibilities of the architect will end up being very different than a developer in the long run.

In general it is a very good idea to clarify the title both with the recruiter and when talking to the members of the company during interviews or introductory calls. Especially if you see titles that have a '/' with the higher level role stated as well.

This will most likely not happen if you are interviewing with the large corporations like the Googles and Microsofts of the world.

# Understand your Core Responsibilities

In order to spark your interest a recruiter or internal member of the company might talk about many exiting things that is happening within the company and tell you about cool innovative projects etc. The question is will you be working on them?

Sometimes if you show interest in a particular topic the recruiter might tell you about how the company has a program or a project related to that. What you have to do is to make sure to understand if your core responsiblities will have anything to do with what is being talked about in the conversations. The majority of your time will be focused on your core responsibilities. It is very important that you are excited about that and not the stuff others will be working on.

For instance hese days for every two words you read on the internet one of them is AI or Machine (ML)Learning. Let's say you are really interested in AI. A Recruiter might tell you about how the company is investing in machine learning looking into the future, but will you actually be doing anything that is realted to the topic as a part of your core responsibility?

Asking these clarifying questions will give you a good sense of what the reality of the role entails so that you are certain what you are pursuing is in line with what your career goals are.
